I previously came across this book, Algorithms to Live By, and brushed it off as just another marketing stunt that takes advantage of the "Learn to Code" wave splashing across the globe. With buzzwords like "Artificial Intelligence" and "Neural Networks" flying across boardrooms and offices, I'm not surprised to see "Algorithms" finally get their space on bookshelves too.

But recently I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lwhw2iaFRo&t=7s) by a local Youtuber and was definitely intrigued. In it, he discusses how his teeth is so white (tldw; Crest whitestrips and a good dental routine) and how he brushes his teeth. I remembered being taught this in primary school but completely forgot about it as time went on. So I decided to follow a simplified regimen for my toothbrushing.

As I continued to change the routine to suit my own needs, I realized that this was basically similar to implementing a more "correct" and "efficient" algorithm to my toothbrushing problem. For the uninitiated,

> An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems

Previously, I would brush without any specific procedure and just end when I felt I had brushed for long enough. This would usually result in an unusually long time taken to clean my pearly browns (*the coffee stains have not come off*). But by updating my algorithm, I was able to solve the problem of cleaning my teeth more effectively and efficiently. 

As I continued to mull over this, I realized that algorithms really do make up a big part of our lives, whether we know about it or not. But by understanding that we have task that we need to solve and its criteria for success, we can better implement procedure to make them easier and faster to solve.

Granted, we aren't mindless calculators and success isn't always easily definable, but applying good algorithms to the problems that are will give us more time to solve life's more difficult problems. Moving forward, I'll be more aware of how algorithms can make my life a lot more easier. Hopefully, you'll get to follow my toothbrushing routine too ðŸ™‚.
