I'll be doing weekly posts to recap the things I have learnt so far. It doesn't always have to be coding / technical related posts, just things I have found to be interesting / helpful!

## Jekyll
As a new user to Jekyll and Ruby, here's a recap of what I learnt:

### 1. `_drafts`: store drafts (wow) without becoming posts.
To see them on your local site though, run
```ruby
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
```

### 2. Changing the layout of the home (index) page
Currently using the Minimal Mistakes theme. I wanted the home page to be a posts with the years categorized.

1. Change the `index.html` file to `index.md`
There should be no issues here; the index file has the same header layout as other md files
2. Change the content of `index.md` to suit your needs.
In my case, it went from:
```ruby
---
layout: home
author_profile: true
---
```
to:
```ruby
---
title: "Posts By Year"
layout: posts # this is the main change to make!
author_profile: true
---
```

### 3. Embed pdf into jekyll pages
Wanted to post a pdf that people can view. Here's a method that shows pdf files from your Google Drive!
1. Go to your file and select `Get Link`
![png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/twil1/embed_pdf_snip.png){: .center-image }

2. Copy the link and edit it like this
```python
old_link = https://drive.google.com/file/d/<filename>/view?usp=sharing
# remove the view, change to preview
new_link = https://drive.google.com/file/d/<filename>/preview
```




### 4. Some important keywords
1. "Wide" posts. Used in my titanic practice page!
```ruby
---
layout: posts
title: My Titanic Practice
permalink: /titanic
classes: wide  # this is the important change
---
```

2. Show your author profile sidebar on a page
```ruby
...
author_profile: true
...
```

3. To get the search button on Minimal Mistakes Theme, go to your `config.yml`
```ruby
search: true # true, false (default)
```

### 5. Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Jekyll posts
This used to be very difficult and tedious. Luckily, someone came up with a library to solve it :). Introducing: *jekyllnb*! A quick guide / reminder:

1. install it
```
python -m pip install jekyllnb
```

2. To use it on an existing notebook
Use cmd in the location of the notebook
```
python -m jupyter jekyllnb --site-dir docs --page-dir _posts --image-dir assets/images my_notebook.ipynb
```
* All your new files will be stored in the `docs` folder.
* The `docs\_posts` folder will contain your notebook converted to .md file
* The `docs\assets\images\my_notebook` folder will contain all the images that are used in your notebook.
* For a more comprehensive guide: [read the docs](https://jekyllnb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
