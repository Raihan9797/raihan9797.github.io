My Name is Raihan and I'm a final year Business Analytics student at the National University of Singapore! 

This blog is a space for me to practice my personal writing skills as I try to break down the things I have learnt into manageable chunks. I'm also using this as a repository of useful code snippets that I can always refer back when I need them.
