I'll be doing weekly posts to recap the things I have learnt so far. It doesn't always have to be coding / technical related posts, just things I have found to be interesting / helpful!

## Jekyll
As a new user to Jekyll and Ruby, here's a recap of what I learnt:

### 1. `_drafts`: store drafts (wow) without becoming posts.
To see them on your local site though, run
```ruby
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
```

### 2. Changing the layout of the home (index) page
Currently using the Minimal Mistakes theme. I wanted the home page to be a posts with the years categorized.

1. Change the `index.html` file to `index.md`
There should be no issues here; the index file has the same header layout as other md files
2. Change the content of `index.md` to suit your needs.
In my case, it went from:
```ruby
---
layout: home
author_profile: true
---
```
to:
```ruby
---
title: "Posts By Year"
layout: posts # this is the main change to make!
author_profile: true
---
```

### 3. Embed pdf into jekyll pages
Wanted to post a pdf that people can view. Here's a method that shows pdf files from your Google Drive!
1. Go to your file and select `Get Link`
![png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/twil1/embed_pdf_snip.png){: .center-image }

2. Copy the link and edit it like this
```
old_link = https://drive.google.com/file/d/<filename>/view?usp=sharing
# remove the view, change to preview
new_link = https://drive.google.com/file/d/<filename>/preview
```




### 4. Some important keywords

### 5. Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Jekyll posts
This used to be very difficult and tedious. Luckily, someone came up with a library to solve it :).
