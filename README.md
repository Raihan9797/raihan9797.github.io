# Important things that I have learnt:
1. When you use flex-direction: column; remember that justify-content now becomes align-items!

2. How to use font awesome by using an old version (4.7.0) which only requires a link vs downloading files vs using the current version which requires you to sign up (and troubleshoot as there are some errors with rendering the icons?) Go with 4.7.0 as it works for now.
- You can also find logo sites because font awesome is very hard to do multi colours

3. Search color schemes and palettes for better matching of colors

4. Don't be afraid to start a new file for testing purposes or to even restart once your files get a bit too messy. Eg: nav_test and old_index.html

* smooth scrolling bug: when you click on the same section too many times when you are already at the section, the function will get "stuck" until you have moved enough times; resolve this by trying to 'break' the function when the scrollPos is the same as the intended scrollPos
